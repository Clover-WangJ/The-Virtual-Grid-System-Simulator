# The-Virtual-Grid-System-Simulator
With the increasing demand on multi-cluster distributed systems as infrastructure, the virtual grid system simulator (the VGS) can help the designers to cope with the important features of a distributed system. We proposed a unidirectional ring architecture for the VGS to simulate a small or medium grid system. The key features of the application include its ability to share load even in very imbalanced situation. Moreover, it is proved to be at least \textit{1-fault-tolerant}. The experiment is setup on Amazon EC2 instances and the results show that our implementation can meet the system requirements.
